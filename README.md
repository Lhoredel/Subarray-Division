# Subarray-Division
This code solves the Birthday Chocolate problem by finding how many contiguous segments of a chocolate bar sum to a specific value matching the birthday day and month. The code slides a window of length 'm' across the chocolate bar segments, calculating the sum of each contiguous segment and counting how many segments sum exactly to 'd'.
